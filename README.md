# Extravasation

Extravasation is a process of lymphocyte migration from blood stream through vessel walls towards a tumour. It serves a major role in T-cell immunnotherapies as it directly affects its efficiency. 
Lymphocyte motion is driven by flow of blood and presence of adhesive particles, selectins and integrins. In a big shortcut, those two allow forming of bonds that subsequently cause cell to roll on vessel wall. If bond forces overpowered fluid flow, the cell stops and we assume migration can occur.
Studies have shown that radiotherapy has a significant impact on expression of adhesive particles. 
This repository contains one part from bigger project created while attending course "Biomathematics in practise" at University of Warsaw. It focuses on finding surfaces fitting data from articles describing expression of selectins/integrins under radiotherapy.
